    "text": "LLMs present enormous opportunity but can also lead to organisational ”analysis paralysis”: Where and when do we start? How do we generate actual value? Should we wait for the models to mature? How do we position ourselves for the future?\nDifferent verticals have their own requirements, and the challenges are substantial. But in our experience, the correct starting point is already clear: focus on your data. Organisations that start now and focus on the creation, collection and curation of data - and the infrastructure to support it - will dominate.\nThe new technology does mandate some changes to what is created and collected, but the bulk of the work lies in rigorously applying techniques which are already well-understood - but rarely well-implemented."
