  <title>The Importance of Data</title>
  <link>https://alexclaydon.dev/posts/importance-of-data/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>LLMs present enormous opportunity but can also lead to organisational ”analysis paralysis”: Where and when do we start? How do we generate actual value? Should we wait for the models to mature? How do we position ourselves for the future?</p>
<p>Different verticals have their own requirements, and the challenges are substantial. But in our experience, the correct starting point is already clear: focus on your data. Organisations that start now and focus on the creation, collection and curation of data - and the infrastructure to support it - will dominate.</p>
<p>The new technology does mandate some changes to what is created and collected, but the bulk of the work lies in rigorously applying techniques which are already well-understood - but rarely well-implemented.</p>
